# Data_augmentation
In this repository we will put data augmentation projects

## Data augmentation
When we don't have enough training samples to cover diverse cases in image classification, often CNN might overfit. To address this we use a technique called data augmentation in deep learning. Data augmentation is used to generate new training samples from current training set using various transformations such as scaling, rotation, contrast change etc.
